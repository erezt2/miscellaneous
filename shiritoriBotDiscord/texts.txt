there is a set turn order that is decided by whomever created the game.

on each turn, players need to send a word that starts with the last letter of the previus words.

players need to write such word within the set timit limit.

its possible to add constraint on player so their words can't end with a certain letter/ combination.

if someone sends an invalid word you have to use the last letter of the word of the last person.

players can join each game more than once.

add the shiritori bot to the game to get fucked in lmao.

if the shiritori bot goes first he will wait exactly 10 seconds before starting.
